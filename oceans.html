                    Indian Ocean is located between Africa and Austral-Asia and the Southern Ocean. is the third largest
                    of our oceans and covers a fifth ( 20%) of our earths surface. Until the mid 1800s the Indian Ocean
                    was called the Eastern Oceans. The Indian Ocean is around 5.5 times the size of United States and is
                    a warm body of water depending on the Ocean Currents of the Equator to help stabilize the

                    Ocean Plastic
                    The Pacific Ocean is also the home for the most micro plastics floating in our oceans. The plastic
                    are caused by humans littering by accident or just littering. Plastic pollution makes its way to the
                    ocean in many directions by getting into street drains, rivers, blowing in the wind, or from fishing
                    boats. learn about how some animals help lower plastic pollution.
